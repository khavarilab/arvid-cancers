Column,Details
Tested SNP,RefSNP ID (rsID) of SNPs tested if they were in linkage disequilibrium with a GWAS SNP linked to a cancer and are found in DHS peaks in a cell type associated with that cancer
Reference,reference allele (this is not necessarily the major allele or the protective allele)
Alternate,alternate allele (this is not necessarily the minor allele or disease risk allele)
Hit in Cancer Assoc Cell Type,celltype(s) in which alleles are differentially active by MPRA and associated with a relevant cancer by GWAS
Hit in Any Cell Type,celltype(s) in which alleles are differentially active by MPRA
Nearest Gene,nearest gene to tested SNP
Nearby Genes,gene with promoter within 5kb of the tested SNP
Chromosome,chromosome number in GRCh37
Position,SNP position in GRCh37
Lead SNP,rsID of the SNP analyzed in the GWAS study which implicated the locus
Associated Cancer,cancer type associated with the lead SNP from the GWAS study
PubMedID,study associated with the GWAS lead SNP
OR or BETA,the odds ratio or beta associated with the GWAS lead SNP mined from the GWAS catalog
ptGene GTEx,ptGene for the SNP from GTEx in the tissues corresponding to its GWAS cancer association
ptGene HiChIP,genes with promoters in contact with the SNP by H3K27Ac HiChIP in cell types corresponding to its GWAS cancer axsociation (Donohue et al. Cell Genomics 2022) 
ptGene eQTLGen,ptGene for the SNP from eQLTgen
Tissue GTEx,the tissue in GTEx in which the SNP is a significant eQTL (only those that correspond to its cancer)
HiChIP Cell Type,the cell type in which the gene noted in ptGene HiCHIP was found
